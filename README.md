##Repo usage
*Do not clone or push to* **master** *branch.*

Create branch or fork from **develop**, then push or create pull requests (if you don't have access) to that branch.

The repo uses [this branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

##Demo project
There is a demo where you can see both the jQuery plugin and the server in action.

 1. Run the server
	> cd server/
	> npm start

 2. Open `/demo/index.html` in your favourite browser.
