##Repo usage
*Do not clone or push to* **master** *branch.*

Create branch or fork from **develop**, then push or create pull requests (if you don't have access) to that branch.

##Demo project
There is a demo where you can see both the jQuery plugin and the server in action.

 1. Run the server

		cd server/
		npm start

 2. Open `/demo/index.html` in your favourite browser.
